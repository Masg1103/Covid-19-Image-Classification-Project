Background and Context
Covid-19 is a fast-growing disease that affects human health severely. Patients diagnosed with this condition suffer from lung infections. The medical community has recently released vaccines that have a slower effect in increasing immunity. This virus has impacted various countries\' human health and financial standards.

Deep learning algorithms have recently used image classification to identify medical images. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) can be widely utilized to identify COVID-19 to assist radiologists in medical analysis by classifying patients who are healthy, have viral pneumonia, or are affected by COVID using X-ray pictures of the lungs.

The aim of this project is two folds:

Build a deep learning model  to differentiate an X-ray image of a normal person from an unhealthy one.

Build an app using Streamlit for users to make predictions or inference using your model.

I built a CNN model and a Densenet Model where the CNN model did better and predicted better.
